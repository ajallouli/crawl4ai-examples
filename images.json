They were produced in response to silver agitation by citizens who were angered by the Coinage Act of 1873 , which had effectively placed the United States on a gold standard . Since 1968 they have been redeemable only in Federal Reserve Notes and are thus obsolete, but they remain legal tender at their face value and hence are still an accepted form of currency. This five-dollar bill , a 1953 silver certificate bearing the first serial number of a printing of 339,600,000 banknotes, is part of the National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of American History . It features a portrait of President Abraham Lincoln on the obverse and the facade of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., on the reverse.
